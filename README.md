# Western Music Notation for Java (wmn4j)

wmn4j is a Java API for handling western music notation.
The main purpose of wmn4j is to enable easy and efficient analysis of scores and wmn4j is intended to also provide funtionality for algorithmic composition by generating scores.

## The structure of wmn4j

The [API Documentation](https://otsob.github.io/wmn4j/index.html) provides a comprehensive overview of all classes and interfaces in wmn4j. There are a few architectural design principles in wmn4j:
* All notation classes are immutable
* Builder classes are used for creating objects
* Scores can be read using different types of iterators

### Building wmn4j

wmn4j uses Maven and can be run by running Maven install. With the current configuration the Javadocs are also updated in the process.
